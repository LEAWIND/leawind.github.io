# Configuration

The configuration file for this mod is in JSON format and is located in the game's run directory under `config/leawind_third_person.json`.

This document only covers some important configurations.

## Item Matching Rules

There are two configurable string lists in the configuration:

| ID                   | Name                | Description                                                                         |
| -------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `aim_item_rules`     | Held Item Rules     | Automatically enters aim mode when the item held in the player's main or off-hand matches any rule in the list. |
| `use_aim_item_rules` | Used Item Rules     | Automatically enters aim mode when the item the player is currently using matches any rule in the list.           |

### Rule Syntax

Matching rules can be of three structures:
| Structure           | Meaning                       | Example                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Item ID             | Matches any item with the same ID | `egg`, `minecraft:egg`       |
| NBT Tag             | Matches any item with the specified NBT tag structure | `{Charged:1b}`               |
| Item ID with NBT Tag | Matches items that satisfy both conditions | `crossbow{Charged:1b}`       |
