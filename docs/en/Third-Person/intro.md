# Leawind's Third Person

This mod provides enhanced third person perspective.

::: info
This is a client-side mod.
:::

::: warning
This documentation is only for the latest version (2.0.6+).
:::

## Features

Switch between first-person and third-person perspectives by pressing F5.

### Switch Left|Right|Center

A short press of CapsLock can switch between left and right perspectives, while holding CapsLock can switch to the center.

### Adjust Camera Position

:::details
While holding Z, moving the mouse can adjust the camera offset (player's position on the screen), and using the mouse scroll wheel can adjust the camera's distance from the player.
:::

### Auto Activate Aim Mode

:::details
Under specific conditions, you can enter aim mode. Aim mode uses a different camera offset than the normal mode and can be adjusted separately.

The mod will automatically enter aim mode based on the player's held items. For example, under the default configuration, aiming with a bow, trident, or holding items like a charged crossbow or ender pearl will automatically trigger aim mode. You can change these rules in the [Detailed features](./details.md).
:::

### Player Transparency

:::details
When the camera is close to the player or the crosshair is aimed at the player, the player becomes semi-transparent.
:::

::: warning
If you have Optifine installed, please disable the following option; otherwise, the third-person camera rotation may not be smooth.
